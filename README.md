# IP Address Blacklist

This repository contains a collection of IP addresses that were responsible for a DDoS attack on one of my personal machines. By blacklisting these IP addresses on your machine, we can help each other prevent further attacks.

## Directory Structure

There are two types of directories available:

- **Combined**: This directory contains a single script with `ufw deny` rules for each IP address added to the blacklist. It is recommended for first-time users.

- **Separated**: This directory contains separate directories for each date, with `ufw deny` rules for IP addresses added on that particular date. It is recommended for continuous users.

## Contributing

If you have additional IP addresses that you would like to add to the blacklist, please feel free to contribute to this repository. Together, we can make the internet a safer place.
